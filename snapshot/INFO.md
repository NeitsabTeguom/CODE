Git rev:  23f704122b3f8ddde29dfbc8e77d316a6518d7cb

Tests:    206 passed

This snapshot is the canonical recovery binary when ./amc is broken
mid-development. `build_amc.sh` falls back to `snapshot/amc` before
`./build/amc` (Vala) so a known-good Amalgame compiler is always one
rung closer than the original bootstrap.

To recompile the snapshot binary on this platform:

    gcc -O2 -Iruntime snapshot/amc_lib.c -lgc -lm -lcurl -o snapshot/amc

To restore an older snapshot (after a bad commit):

    git checkout <good-rev> -- snapshot/amc_lib.c
    gcc -O2 -Iruntime snapshot/amc_lib.c -lgc -lm -lcurl -o snapshot/amc
