## [v0.3.2] — 2026-05-08

This release closes every open compiler bug tracked in v0.3.1's
`SKIP_SELFHOST` list, restores `try` / `catch` / `throw` / `finally`
end-to-end in the self-hosted parser, and ships the first round of
generic type inference for `List<T>` and `Map<K,V>`. The full test
suite is now **149/149 green with zero SKIPs**.

### Language

- **`try` / `catch` / `throw` / `finally`** restored end-to-end in the
  self-hosted compiler (the Vala bootstrap had it; the rewrite hadn't
  grown a `ParseTry` yet). Lowers via `setjmp`/`longjmp` using the
  existing `_am_throw` runtime helpers.
- **`Type.Variant` patterns in `match`** — `Direction.North => …` is
  now recognised as a pattern. `ParseMatchPattern` reads an optional
  `.IDENT` suffix.
- **Generic type inference (locals + params + returns)**:
  `let xs = new List<int>()`, `xs: List<int>`, `xs = MakeList()`,
  and `Foo(List<int> xs)` all carry the elem type, so `xs.Get(i)`
  lowers to `(int)AmalgameList_get(xs, i)` without a manual cast.
  Same for `Map<K,V>.Get(k)` (which wasn't even dispatched before).
- **`obj.Method()` instance syntax for strings** — `s.Length()`,
  `"foo".Trim()`, `s.Replace(a, b)`, … route through `String_*`.

### Compiler

- **Multi-file type checking** — TypeChecker now walks every parsed
  program (was hard-coded to `programs[0]`).
- **Null-safety** — three independent bugs fixed: NodeKey collision
  in the typechecker (Kind is now part of the key), bare `?` was
  dropped by the lexer (added `OP_QMARK`), and `TypeToC("T?")` no
  longer doubles up the C pointer.

### Formatter

- **Same-line comments** preserved on round-trip: `let x = 1  // foo`
  no longer sees its comment bumped to the next line.
- **`import` directives** preserved: the parser used to discard them.
- `try` / `catch` / `throw` round-trip lossless.

### Tests / infra

- Suite is now **149/149** (87 core + 50 stdlib + 12 fmt) under
  `./amc`. **`SKIP_SELFHOST` is empty.**
- `run_multifile_test` shell helper fixed (was passing `-o foo.c`,
  amc dutifully expanded it to `foo.c.c` and never produced an
  executable).
- `tests/run_all_tests.sh` completes end-to-end for the first time
  (its `set -e` no longer trips on a half-failing suite).
